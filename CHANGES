0.9.6
  * Bugfix: Sometimes malformed or old-format negentropy messages would throw
    uncaught exceptions which would cause the relay to crash. Now it properly
    handles and reports this situation in both logs and to the other side
    of the protocol.
  * New config option: relay.negentropy.enabled. Default is true. Set this to
    false if you wish to entirely stop the relay from handling negentropy messages.

0.9.5
  * New feature: strfry router!
  * INCOMPATIBLE change: The "lookbehind" feature of plugins was removed
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol! (again)
    - The fingerprint function has now been changed to SHA-256, to protect the
      integrity of the sync mechanism in the presence of adversarial event creators
    - Going forward, the protocol now has mechanisms for backwards/forwards compatibility
  * Bugfix: Prevent a crash when a non-indexOnly scan was paused and then one of the
    buffered levIds was deleted or replaced before the scan resumed
  * Plugins can now be specified as shell commands, so you can pass command-line switches
    to them, set environment variables, use pipes/redirects, etc.
  * Plugins now propagate the environment variables of the strfry process to the
    plugin processes
  * Now if you don't return a "msg" (or return an empty string), it will no longer
    pollute your logs with "blocked event" messages

0.9.4
  * INCOMPATIBLE change to negentropy sync protocol!
    - Necessary because the protocol had an unfixable issue when syncing a very large DB
      into a small DB while using frameSizeLimit (sorry!)
  * If a client disconnects before its pending EVENT write messages have been processed,
    drop those messages instead of trying to write them
  * Bulk export commands now exit gracefully on a SIGPIPE
  * Fixed a race condition when sync command exits
  * Some optimisations in sync and export
  * noReadAhead config option: can reduce IO usage on instances where DB size > memory
  * Close the LMDB map file when execing plugins (works around LMDB bug)

0.9.3
  * Limit on events that can be processed by a sync
    - Configurable with relay.negentropy.maxSyncEvents
  * Warn when NIP-11 pubkey is in incorrect format (#52)
  * Bugfix: Setting rejectEphemeralEventsOlderThanSeconds larger than ephemeralEventsLifetimeSeconds did
    not work because events were then considered expired
  * Config parameter to silence "Rejected invalid event" logs: relay.logging.invalidEvents
  * Detect overflows when rejectEvents* config params are set very large
